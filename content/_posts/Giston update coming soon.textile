h2. Update

Apparently, quite a few people got interested in giston lately. I am actually in the middle of rewriting some of the ugliness and didn't bother to let people know about it. My bad.

I'll be committing some changes on Friday noon-ish gmt so please don't patch against the current version as things most likely won't apply anymore. If you already have a patch, please email it to me and I'll try to apply your changes manually.

Sorry about the lack of transparency, I thought noone was using it, heh :).
