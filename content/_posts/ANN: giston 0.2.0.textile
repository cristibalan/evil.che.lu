h2. Update

*This article is outdated: Please read about "braid 0.3.0":http://evil.che.lu/2008/2/13/ann-braid-0-3-0*

"Giston":http://evil.che.lu/projects/giston is a simple tool to help track svn vendor branches in your git repository. Itâ€™s loosely based on the idea of piston, but itâ€™s more simplistic and it does less.

h2. Get it

 git clone git://git.che.lu/giston.git
 cd giston
 sudo ruby setup.rb
 giston --help # see usage

h2. giston 0.2.0 changes

* now using the "main" gem for command line arguments parsing
* rewrote the command handling and cleaned up the code
* broke "giston update" when used without a mirror name

Please be aware that giston is, still, very immature and might(read: will) unexpectedly break at points. Make sure to commit any local changes before using giston.

I'll create a rubyforge project for issue tracking and gem releasing next week. At the moment I can't seem to login to rubyforge. Not to mention that I have to chase some beers around :).

Have fun and please let me know of any bugs, complaints, ideas or patches you might have.
