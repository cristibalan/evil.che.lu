"Braid":http://github.com/evilchelu/braid/wikis/home is a simple tool to help track git and svn vendor branches in a git repository.

This is a major release that brings two main features (no more braid/track branch and better merging support) and lots of usability changes, bugfixes and tweaks.

The "braid project page":http://github.com/evilchelu/braid/wikis/home has now moved to github, mainly because we wanted to use the wiki for documentation.

Braid now also has a google group. If you have questions or ideas about braid, please subscribe to "http://groups.google.com/group/braid-gem":http://groups.google.com/group/braid-gem.
