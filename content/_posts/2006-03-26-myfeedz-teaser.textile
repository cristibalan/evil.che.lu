The thing that's been keeping me busy lately is almost ready to be let loose out in the world. "myFeedz":http://myfeedz.com/ is a kind of feed reader/meme tracker thingy that learns from your reading habits and those of people with similar interests and creates your personal view of the current news.

The core functionality is now in place and we're just polishing things up a bit to prepare for the private beta. If you're interested in being part of it, put your email address in the little box over at "myFeedz":http://myfeedz.com/ and we'll let you know as soon as you can play with it.
