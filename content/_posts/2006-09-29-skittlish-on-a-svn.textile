I updated "skittlish":http://evil.che.lu/projects/skittlish to work with the latest mephisto (currently r2293).

There are no guarantees regarding how this works with the experimental mephisto theme management interface. If you don't like to fiddle, I'll zip up a new version of skittlish once mephisto 0.7 is released.

_(cue scary music)_
h1. BOO!!!

"Not scared?":http://mephistoblog.com/2006/9/20/scare-tactics Okay, you can grab it from svn:

<pre>

svn co svn://evil.che.lu/evilchelu/svn/projects/themes/skittlish/trunk /blah/blah//themes/site-1/other/skittlish

</pre>
