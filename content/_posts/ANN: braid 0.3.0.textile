h2. Update

"braid 0.3.2":http://evil.che.lu/2008/2/14/ann-braid-0-3-2 was released to fix some major bugs

"Braid":http://evil.che.lu/projects/braid is a simple tool to help track svn and git vendor branches in your git repository. It used to be called giston and was more hackish.

There is no direct way to update your giston mirrors to braid mirros, sorry :(. You know, life on the edge and stuff, heh.

h2. Get it

 git clone git://github.com/evilchelu/braid.git
 cd braid
 rake install_gem
 braid --help # see usage

h2. giston 0.3.0 changes from giston 0.2.0

* using YAML::Store to save config
* using git merge-subtree with git and git svn remotes to track repositories

Rubyforge project on the way. I'll update this page when it's ready.

Have fun and please let me know of any bugs, complaints, ideas or patches you might have.

h2. Usage

From the README:

create a git repo

 git init moo
 cd moo

ideally you will also do these, but they are just good practices

 git config --global merge.summary true
 git checkout -b localwork

adding mirrors

 braid add git://blah
 braid add svn://muh
 gitk braid/track
 git merge braid/track

updating mirrors

 braid update muh
 braid update
 git merge braid/track

removing mirrors

 braid remove blah
 braid remove muh
 git merge braid/track
