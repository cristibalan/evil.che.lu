If you got "braid":http://evil.che.lu/projects/braid from the git repository before 12:40GMT, please pull the latest changes.

The 0.3.0 version has a bug where it will clone the mirrored svn repositories entierly. braid 0.3.1 just grabs the HEAD revision and this is significantly faster.

h2. Changes

BUGFIXES

* braid was fetching entire repositories for svn mirros. changed to fetch only HEAD
* workaround for stupid git svn behaviour. it is transforming all _ (underscores) into . (periods) in git svn remote branch names
** braid now is replacing all _ with - preemtively

BUGS

* braid only works with a quite recent git (I'm using latest from the git git repo). I know that git 1.5.2 definitely doesn't work (git fetch is acting up). Not sure about versions in between.

 cd braid
 git pull

Mihai Anca has written a nice article showing some real world braid usage: "Installing rspec with braid":http://ropiku.wordpress.com/2008/02/04/installing-rspec-with-braid/

He also helped track down the stupid bugs in the 0.3.0 release. I have beers already prepared.
