Yay, it happened! After mercilessly leaving one domain gathering dust and then having this new one starting to rot, I finally got my act together and started typing.

This will be the home of my projects, ideas and thoughts about stuff, mostly web related and hopefully useful to someone.

It runs on the "nice cms thingy":http://techno-weenie.net/svn/projects/mephisto/trunk/ by "technoweenie":http://techno-weenie.net/ and it looks this ugly because I lack the design fu needed to make it better.

*Update:* "Ugly no more":http://evil.che.lu/2006/6/28/ugly-no-more
