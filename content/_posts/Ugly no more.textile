Thanks to the awesome "Damien Tanner":http://iamrice.org who was kind enough to let me use one of his designs, this weblog now looks amazingly cool... and orange! All I had to do is chop it up, add some evil faces and sprinkle some CSS over it :).

Watch this space for a more complete theme for mephisto based on his lovely design, including more colors and less bugs. Also, if I have time and people really like it, I might port it to some other platforms (typo and possibly wordpress).
